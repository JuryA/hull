# HULL - Helm UtiLity Library

This repository contains the HULL Helm library chart. It is designed to ease building, maintaining and configuring Kubernetes objects in Helm charts and can be added to any Helm chart as an functionality addon without risk of breaking exising Helm charts functionalities.

The chart itself can be found in the [`hull`](hull) folder. 

The self-created Kubernetes API JSON Schemas are stored in the [`kubernetes-json-schema`](kubernetes-json-schema) folder.
